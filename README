This is version 1.00 of the perl GSD module
-------------------------------------------

The James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), Mauna Kea, Hawaii uses
an in-house format for storing spectral line and UKT14 continuum data.
This format is called the Global Section Data format (GSD).

This module gives read only access to JCMT data. All new continuum
data from SCUBA uses the NDF format; please use the NDF module for
accessing SCUBA data.

A perldl reader is also included (PDL::IO::GSD) - for version 1.11 of
perldl. The gsdprint and gsdformat commands are included to dump the
contents of a GSD file.

Requirements
------------

Perl 5.001, this module has been tested on 5.002, 5.003  and 5.004
on Sparc Solaris 2.5. More recently it has been tested on perl 5.8.0
and RedHat 7.3.

The C GSD library is available separately. See
http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-store/storeform1?GSD
with documentation at
http://www.starlink.ac.uk/star/docs/sun229.htx/sun229.html


The library will only work on Alpha/OSF1, Sun Solaris and SunOS.
The FORTRAN binding has been removed from this distribution of the
C library.

The PDL module requires perldl v1.11 or newer

Installation
------------

Please edit the Makefile.PL to reflect the location of your math
libraries. By default the GSD library used is the Starlink
installed version.

Then installation is simply:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

A manual page is included in the module. Information on using the C GSD
library itself is not included.
